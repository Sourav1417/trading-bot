# Trading Bot System

ðŸ‘‹Hello all, I am Sourav Mohanty. I am a Web Developer, Front-end Developer, Full-Stack Developer and a Software Developer. 

-> This is a Trading bot system which job is to keep track of all the transactions. First it has to identify the wallets  and then it has to keep track of those wallets. 
Each transaction soon as the user buys some Solana that means he's going to buy that token, so before he buys it, the bot has to buy it and then it has to wait for him to buy it. 
As soon as he buys, the bot need to sell it. It can have customized parameters over here. It also has to look for any new holders. So this bot also watching the token itself for any new holders. And then the bot find the wallet where they are only trading the hero token  and then you keep track of those wallets. So in general, it willb uy before they buy and sell after they sell. \
-> To achieve this system I used Python, PostgreSQL and psycopg2.
